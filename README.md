### Description

This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the feasibility of real-time communication through an online chat and video-conference service, leveraging [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) and [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/?hl=en) technologies.
The PoC aims to validate our proposal by showcasing a seamless exchange between users and customer service representatives, ensuring a robust and interactive user experience.

### Why WebSockets & WebRTC?

WebSockets enable persistent, bidirectional communication between the client and server, allowing for instant message delivery and low-latency interactions.
WebRTC facilitates peer-to-peer connections for audio, video, and data sharing, ensuring high-quality real-time communication without the need for intermediary servers.
By developing this PoC, we aim to reassure stakeholders of the viability and effectiveness of our proposed online chat functionality.

## Pre-requisites

### Node.js

Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en) to install the Front-End dependencies.

## Configuration  

### Node.js

The project requires Node.js version 20.11.0

You can install Node.js also using the [node version manager (nvm)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), after clicking on the latest release and installing the  `nvm-setup.exe` file, you can upgrade or downgrade node version using the `nvm` commands

Here's the steps:

1. Check the list of node versions installed:

    ```shell
    nvm ls

    # Output example:
    # * 16.15.0 (Currently using 64-bit executable)
    ```

2. Install the node version to upgrade/downgrade to:

    ```shell
      nvm install 20.11.0
    ```

3. Use the freshly installed version:

    ```shell
      nvm ls
      # 20.11.0
      # * 16.13.1 (Currently using 64-bit executable)

      nvm use 20.11.0
      # Now using node v20.11.0 (64-bit)
    ```

**In case it doesn't work:**

Go to the `nodejs/` folder and slightly rename it, then re-execute `nvm use 20.11.0`

## Installation procedure

**Cloning the project:**
To clone this repository from GitHub, run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/LePhenix47/Lahouiti_Younes_P5_30122023 .`

### Front-End

1. Install the dependencies:

To start the Angular Front-End project, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the Front-End directory in your terminal:

```shell
cd front
```

- Install project dependencies using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

2. Starting the server

- After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```shell
npm run dev-https

# If you use Bun with `bun dev-https`, it will work just fine
```

This command will compile the Angular application and start a development server in HTTPS (WebRTC requires a secure context to function correctly).
You can then access the application in your browser at `https://localhost:4200`.

### Back-End

1. Install the dependencies:

To start the NodeJS Back-End project, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the Back-End directory in your terminal:

```shell
cd back
```

- Install project dependencies using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

2. Starting the server

- After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```shell
npm start

# If you use the Bun JS runtime you can also use `bun start`
```

This command will start the NodeJS development server.
You can then access the API with: `https://localhost:3000`.

## Features and limitations

## WebRTC Peer-to-Peer Connection Setup

This document outlines the process of setting up a peer-to-peer connection using WebRTC. The flow includes steps for both the sender and the receiver of the connection.

### Get User Media (G.U.M.)

Use `getUserMedia()` to access the user's camera and microphone, and `getDisplayMedia()` to access the user's screen.

```js
const ls1 = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true }); // User's webcam and microphone
const ls2 = await navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({ video: true, audio: false  }); // User's screen
```

### Create Peer Connection

Create an `RTCPeerConnection` object.

```js
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection(turnOrStunConfig);
```

### Add Local Tracks to the Connection

Add local media tracks to the peer connection.

```js
ls1.getTracks().forEach(track => pc.addTrack(track));
ls2.getTracks().forEach(track => pc.addTrack(track));
```

### Add Event Listeners to Peer Connection

Listen for various events on the peer connection.

```js
pc.onicecandidate = (event) => { /* Handle ICE candidates */ };
pc.ontrack = (event) => { /* Handle remote track */ };
pc.onnegotiationneeded = (event) => { /* Handle negotiation */ };
pc.onsignalingstatechange = (event) => { /* Debug signaling state */ };
```

### ICE Candidate Event

When an ICE candidate is found, send it to the other peer via the signaling server.

```js
socket.emit("ice-candidate", event.candidate);
```

### ICE Candidate WebSocket Response

When receiving an ICE candidate from the signaling server, add it to the peer connection.

```js
socket.on("ice-candidate", (candidate) => pc.addIceCandidate(candidate));
```

### Sender (offerer)

#### User Wants to Initiate Call

Create an offer, set the local description, and send the offer via the signaling server.

```js
const offer = await pc.createOffer();
await pc.setLocalDescription(offer);
socket.emit("offer", offer);
```

#### Set Remote Description (Answer)

When receiving an answer, set the remote description.

```js
socket.on("answer", async (answer) => {
    await pc.setRemoteDescription(answer);
});
```

### Receiver (answerer)

#### Set Remote Description (Offer)

When receiving an offer, set the remote description.

```js
socket.on("offer", async (offer) => {
    await pc.setRemoteDescription(offer);
    const answer = await pc.createAnswer();
    await pc.setLocalDescription(answer);
    socket.emit("answer", answer);
});
```

#### Create Answer and Set Local Description

Create an answer, set the local description, and send the answer via the signaling server.

### On Track Event

When a remote media track is added, handle it by creating a new MediaStream and adding the track to it.

```js
pc.ontrack = (event) => {
    const remoteStream = new MediaStream();
    event.streams[0].getTracks().forEach(track => remoteStream.addTrack(track));
    remoteVideoElement.srcObject = remoteStream;
};
```

### On Negotiation Needed Event

When negotiation is needed, handle it appropriately (e.g., create and send a new offer if necessary).

#### Frontend (FE)

- `offer`: Emitted when the initiating peer creates an offer.
- `ice-candidate`: Emitted when an ICE candidate is generated.
- `answer`: Emitted when the receiving peer creates an answer.

#### Backend (BE)

- `offer`: Broadcasts the SDP offer from the initiating peer to the receiving peer.
- `ice-candidate`: Broadcasts the ICE candidates between peers.
- `answer`: Broadcasts the SDP answer from the receiving peer to the initiating peer.

##### Initiating Peer

**Outgoing Events:**

1. **Send SDP offer:**

   ```js
   socket.emit('offer', {
     type: 'offer',
     sdp: peerConnection.localDescription
   });
   ```

2. **Send ICE candidates:**

   ```js
   peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
     if (event.candidate) {
       socket.emit('ice-candidate', {
         candidate: event.candidate
       });
     }
   };
   ```

**Incoming Events:**

1. **Receive SDP answer:**

   ```js
   socket.on('answer', async (message) => {
     await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(message));
   });
   ```

2. **Receive ICE candidates:**

   ```js
   socket.on('ice-candidate', async (message) => {
     try {
       await peerConnection.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(message.candidate));
     } catch (e) {
       console.error('Error adding received ice candidate', e);
     }
   });
   ```

##### Receiving Peer

**Outgoing Events:**

1. **Send SDP answer:**

   ```js
   socket.emit('answer', {
     type: 'answer',
     sdp: peerConnection.localDescription
   });
   ```

2. **Send ICE candidates:**

   ```js
   peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
     if (event.candidate) {
       socket.emit('ice-candidate', {
         candidate: event.candidate
       });
     }
   };
   ```

**Incoming Events:**

1. **Receive SDP offer:**

   ```js
   socket.on('offer', async (message) => {
     await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(message));
     const answer = await peerConnection.createAnswer();

     // Emit the answer, see "Send SDP answer"
   });
   ```

2. **Receive ICE candidates:**

   ```js
   socket.on('ice-candidate', async (message) => {
     try {
       await peerConnection.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(message.candidate));
     } catch (e) {
       console.error('Error adding received ice candidate', e);
     }
   });
   ```
